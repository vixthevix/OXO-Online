when using command prompt, use the cd OneDrive\Documents\Victor\project_personnel\OXO_online line

in order to keep file access consistent within the folder.

when running in general,
DO NOT WRITE PYTHON3, it will use the latest version of python3 which I do not have. Instead write python.

use pyinstaller and make sure it is written as "pyinstaller --onefile your_file.py"
